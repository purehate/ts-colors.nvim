# ts-colors.nvim

A Neovim theme powered by ts-colors, designed for those who code in the shadows of cyberspace. Inspired by the legendary Gruber Darker, this version is built entirely in Lua for optimal performance and seamless integration with modern workflows.

“There is no right and wrong. There’s only fun and boring.” – Hackers (1995)

Based on Alexey's Gruber Darker theme, but remixed with TrustedSec's signature aesthetic: dark, clean, and optimized for cyber operators.

## Supported Plugins

Like any good hacker, this theme keeps it lean. It plays well with Treesitter, Telescope, and Fugitive, but at its core, it's built for those who prefer stock tools—netrw, vimdiff, and spellcheck are all fully supported.
